# CounterApplication
It counts stuff...(I built this just for fun). If you want to count to 10 from 1, u just have to type "1>10" or if you want to count down, just type "1&lt;10".

All you need to type is "1>10" to type 1 --> 10 and type "1<10" to count down to 1 from 10.
Have fun ummm... counting????
